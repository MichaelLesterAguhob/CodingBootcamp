/* 
	Guides in writing variables:
	    1. Use the 'let/const' keyword followed by the variable name of your choosing and use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value.
	    2. Variable names should start with a lowercase character, use camelCase for multiple words.
	    3. For constant variables, use the 'const' keyword.
	    4. Variable names should be indicative (or descriptive) of the value being stored to avoid confusion.

	When to use JavaScript const? 
		As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

    Use const when you declare:
        - A new Array
        - A new Object
        - A new Function
