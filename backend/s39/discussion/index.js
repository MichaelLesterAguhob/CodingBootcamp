// use the "require" directive to load the express module/package
// a module is a software component/part of a program that contains one or more routines
// this is to get the contents of the express package to be used by our application

// this creates an express application and stores it in a variable app
// In simpler terms, app is our server

// these are called middlewares 
// middlewares is a software that provides common services to the application outside of what's being offered by the operating system.
